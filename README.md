# DsSpeeds
## What is it?
Is a simple application for recording and verifying peak speeds during a flight of a [RC sailplane](http://rcspeeds.com/aircraftdetails.aspx?AC=338) while [Dynamic Soaring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_soaring). A pilot's peak speed for the day is recorded for specific aircraft/site combination by the pilot. The witness can then verify the speed seperately.  This application allows the entry and validation of speeds as well as various seperate views of the whole database: by site; by person; by aircraft; by country etc.

## Why?
It basically is a simple domain that I am personally interested in that is not too complex, nor too simple for trialing different software development techniques and tools. In this instance, it provides an opportunity for me to play with:
 * Event Sourcing
 * CQRS
 * Marten and PostgreSql
 * ASP Web API
 * Angular JS

in my spare time.

## How to get it going
1. Download and install PostgreSql 6.5 or better
2. Setup the Database with the user and password etc
3. install PLV8 for Postress (your version) on the above DB
2. Clone the source
3. Build and enjoy!
4. Optionally take up RC dynamic soaring and be amazed.

## What is Dynamic Soaring?
Dynamic soaring is a flying technique used to gain energy by repeatedly crossing the boundary between air masses of significantly different velocity. Such zones of high wind gradient are generally found close to obstacles and close to the surface, so the technique is mainly of use to birds and operators of radio-controlled gliders, but glider pilots have occasionally been able to soar dynamically in meteorological wind shears at higher altitudes. The highest speeds reported are by radio-controlled gliders at 513 mph (826 km/h).
